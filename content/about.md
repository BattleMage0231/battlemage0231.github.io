## Hi, I'm Leyang!

I am a first-year computer science student at the University of Waterloo who is passionate about technology and learning through building [projects](/projects). 

I have experience programming in Python, C++, Node.js, and Java with an emphasis on developing web applications as well as operating system software like compilers. I have also participated in many mathematics and programming competitions.

Besides coding, some of my hobbies include reading, philosophy, learning French, and playing video games. I might explore some of these hobbies in my [blog](/posts) in the future.

You might also be interested in reading my [résumé](/resume).
